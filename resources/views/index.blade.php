    <p id="indexp">Welcome to Developer Helper! Developer Helper is a site that allows you to generate placeholder text called lorem ipsum, make random users with a variety of identifying information, or create xkcd passwords.
    <br><br>
    Lorem Ipsum Text is generally used for testing out the design and layout of a webpage without having to come up with all of the information right away.
    <br><br>
    Random Users can be used to fill in databases or spreadsheets with randomly generated user information with various indentifying information such as an address, a company, and an age.
    <br><br>
    An xkcd password is a high entropy password specifically designed to be easy to remember by the user and even more secure than a more random but shorter password. It uses common english words to generate each password.
